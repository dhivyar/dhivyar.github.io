            As an NYC[x] Innovation Fellow with the City of New York, I partnered with various city agencies to rapidly solve NYC’s problems with data. 
            - Partnered with the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice and developed the **Hate Crime Index, a first-of-its-kind data product and algorithm built for NYC** that scores the propensity of hate crime occurrences in the city. The index captures ~75% of all hate crime occurrences in the city by targeting ~50% of the police precincts. 
            - Partnered with the Mayor’s Office of Operations and built the **NYC block sampling and route optimization algorithms** for the NYC Street Cleanliness and Scorecard program. The algorithms facilitated and operationalized the collection of cleanliness data points for 17000+ additional blocks in the city annually, a 12x improvement for an effort designed to better the cleanliness-based quality of life for all New Yorkers.
            - Built a **Grant Funding Determination Engine using Machine Learning** for the Department of Cultural Affairs, the largest municipal funder of culture in the US that determines $28 million in funds disbursed for ~2000 cultural organizations in NYC.

            As a Senior Data Scientist, my job role had me build and manage projects at multiple touch-points within BankBazaar.Com- from the core product to operations and marketing.
            - Built the **world's first Interest Rate Deviation Engine using Machine Learning** that predicts the best customers that can be made eligible for an interest rate cut for Personal Loans. The application rate of customers doubled with rate deviation and the approval rate improved by ~5%. 
            - Built **Partner Preference Engines for Credit Cards and Personal Loans**	 that predicts the customer's ‘applying’ behavior and the bank's ‘approval’ behavior. These Machine Learning models are used in the ranking and ordering of product offers and the offer position improved by ~19% for applied offers and by 22% for approved offers. 
            - Built **Application Prioritization Engines using Machine Learning** that enables for efficient customer life-cycle. This was done by predicting an application’s approval probability for Credit Cards and loan disbursal probability for Mortgages, Auto Loans and Personal Loans. The engines capture 80% of all approvals/ disbursals by processing just 50% of applications. 
            - Designed and tracked multiple **targeted and personalized campaigns for Auto Loans** using exploratory analyses. The campaigns drove an additional ~6% application volume to the existing Auto Loan portfolio. 
            - Enhanced **customer data assets** by mining unstructured data sources. The data were classified into different types of transactions using **Natural Language Processing** techniques. 
            - Built **Credit Risk Engines using Machine Learning Algorithms** for unsecured credit products that will assess the credit risk of serious delinquency associated with a customer for a particular credit product. 
            - Built a **Product Recommender Engine** that models on the customers’ historic online behavior data to predict the customers that had the highest propensity to apply for a credit card.

       "I have enjoyed the privilege of working with Dhivya for over 2 years. She is by far one of the most talented data scientists I have ever worked with. What sets Dhivya apart is not just her cutting edge approach to modeling and other machine learning applications, but her ability to explain what she's doing, why she's doing it and even how she's doing it, to the much less informed. As functions like data science are increasingly client facing, this skill is priceless. Dhivya is a powerhouse of knowledge and lives her passion for what she does. She is an incredible asset to any team or project. The icing on the data cake? She's a lovely human to work with! ~ **Janet Thompson, EVP General Manager IPG**" | "Dhivya is one of the best data person I’ve worked with. Her ability to analyze complex data and transform them to actionable insights has helped me countless of times while working with her. Beyond that, she’s also helped push the standard not just for our agency but also delivering future-forward thinking that pushes the industry forward. Dhivya also excels in high pressure situations with C-Suites both internally and externally. She would be valuable in any team she’s in and cannot wait to see what she does next!" ~ **Mitch Wong, Strategy Director IPG**
       "I had the privilege of working with Dhivya as part of a pro bono project to design a map-based searchable directory of immigrant services for Los Angeles County. This tool is the first of its kind for an office of immigrant affairs. I’m thrilled that in five months, Dhivya was able to help us conceptualize, develop, test and launch this critical tool for immigrant community engagement. Dhivya anticipated features and needs we didn’t know we had. I look forward to the next opportunity to work with this data scientist and project manager extraordinaire!" ~ **Michael Nobleza, FUSE Corps Executive Fellow, Los Angeles County Office of Immigrant Affairs** | "It was an absolute pleasure working with Dhivya. I supervised a project where she was a data scientist and developer. We were so impressed by Dhivya that we asked her to stay onto phase 2 of the project. Dhivya is thoughtful, adaptable, and very creative. She was able to seamlessly integrate her data and coding skills and create systems and even a dashboard to strengthen policy makers decision-making on various issues related to hate crimes, bias incidents and public safety. It’s clear that Dhivya is a teamplayer, great communicator, and committed to public service and betterment of society. I hope I have the opportunity to work with her again!" ~ **Hassan Naveed, Deputy Executive Director of The Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes at NYC Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice** 
       "I’ve been working with Dhivya for more than a year now and never come across a peer who apply a structural approach for a problem and come up with an innovative and implementable solution as Dhivya. Strong fundamentals on statistics, love towards data & numbers and advanced skills in analytics tools always put her above rest of the peers. Her willingness to go extra mile, attitude on exploring new things and thirst for learning is exemplary and contribution towards improving the performance of BB product thro’ analytics is fabulous. It’s been a great to share a work place with such a superlative talent as Dhivya." ~ **Praveen Kumar Thandri Vijayaraghavan, Lead Data Scientist II - Decision Science and Analytics at BankBazaar** | "I can’t say enough about the problem solving skills that Dhivya brought to our projects. We had significant challenges and needed results while dealing with massive budget cuts due to the pandemic. Dhivya solved all our problems with open-source software and designed the custom tools to make our project shine. Her patience and thoughtfulness toward our project needs were amazing and matched very well with her overall knowledge and timely production." ~ **Gabrielle Stevenson, Outreach Manager at California State Treasurer’s Office**   
       "Dhivya collaborated with our team from The NYC Department of Cultural Affairs and the Mayor's Office to do a deep-dive analysis of agency funding data. Dhivya approached the project with a broad understanding of what we hoped to achieve and a deep curiosity about the minutae of our data. She created tools for us to identify trends in our data, introducing our team to new concepts and methods while showing us highy useful patterns and trends in our data. This project will be driving policy recommendations moving forward, and we could not have done it without Dhivya's creativity and attention to detail." ~ **Stacey McMath, Director, Programs, New York City Department of Cultural Affairs** | "Dhivya is an expert coder and she can quickly write efficient code for whatever be the analytics task at hand be it web scraping or machine learning. She has good command on current data science languages like R and is a dedicated worker/team player. All the very best Dhivya for all your future endeavours!" ~ **Suniti Srivastava, Vice President - Machine Learning, Royal Bank of Scotland**
